## Setup
Follow the instructions in [Installation](https://github.com/mikuhatsune/wsod_transfer/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to build the projects.

## Data
Follow instructions in [README.old.md](https://github.com/mikuhatsune/wsod_transfer/blob/master/README.old.md) to setup COCO and VOC datasets folder and place the coco and voc files under folder `./datasets`. Annotations for the COCO-60, and VOC datasets on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HhCGksyo1Eza7LhQtISelvyRHNL1iohc?usp=sharing)
- `coco60_train2017_21987.json`, `coco60_val2017_969.json` : place under folder `./datasets/coco/annotations/`
- `voc_2007_trainval.json`, `voc_2007_test.json`: place under `./datasets/voc/VOC2007/`

## Checkpoints
we provide the model checkpoints of object detection network and mil classifier. All checkpoint files are on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HhCGksyo1Eza7LhQtISelvyRHNL1iohc?usp=sharing), place the files under folder `./output/coco60_to_voc/`

## Evaluation
The test results can be obtained by Executing the following commands:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 tools/test_net.py --config-file wsod/coco60_to_voc/mil_it0.yaml OUTPUT_DIR "output/coco60_to_voc/mil_it2" MODEL.WEIGHT "output/coco60_to_voc/mil_it2/model_final.pth" WEAK.CFG2 "output/coco60_to_voc/odn_it2/config.yml"
```
